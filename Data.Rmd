## Data
There are two data sets in ```palmerpenguins```. The first is called ```penguins``` and the second is called ```penguins_raw```. Data from these datasets gives information about species, region, bill length, bill depth, flipper lenght, body mass, and sex. Both data sets contain information for 344 penguins.
