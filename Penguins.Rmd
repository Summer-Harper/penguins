```

## Data
There are two data sets in ```palmerpenguins```. The first is called ```penguins``` and the second is called ```penguins_raw```. Data from these datasets gives information about species, region, bill length, bill depth, flipper lenght, body mass, and sex. Both data sets contain information for 344 penguins. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width= "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/baby-penguin-facts-7488002.png")
```

## Single trait distribution
The mean bill length (mm) for all penguins species is `r  mean(penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)`mm.

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
Adelie_Penguins <- penguins %>% filter(species == "Adelie")
```
The mean bill length (mm) for Adelie penguins is `r  mean(Adelie_Penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)`mm. Adelie penguins have the lowest mean bill length compared to the Chinstrap and Gentoo species. 


``` {r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data=subset(penguins, !is.na(bill_length_mm))) + geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm))
```



## Relationship between multiple traits

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data=subset(penguins, !is.na(bill_length_mm))) + geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm, color = sex))
```

## Sexual dimorphism
