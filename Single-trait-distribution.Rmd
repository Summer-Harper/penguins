## Single trait distribution
The mean bill length (mm) for all penguins species is `r  mean(penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)`mm.

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
Adelie_Penguins <- penguins %>% filter(species == "Adelie")
```
The mean bill length (mm) for Adelie penguins is `r  mean(Adelie_Penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)`mm. Adelie penguins have the lowest mean bill length compared to the Chinstrap and Gentoo species. 


``` {r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data=subset(penguins, !is.na(bill_length_mm))) + geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm))
```
